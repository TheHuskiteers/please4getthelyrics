So you think you know music? Test your knowledge with a music lyric quiz unlike any other.

Using a speech recognition system and the powers of web development, compete against your friends, family, or others in a game of peer-to-peer karaoke. Simply join a room, have the host start the game, and the karaoke will begin.

## Spotify and Karaoke
Using karaoke files for their lyrics and timestamps, we were able to sync up lyrics to their sound waves so that you can visually see the lyrics as you hear them. Syncing the data from this to Spotify allows us to stream these songs to the player in question without a sweat.

## Speech to Text Recognition
This project uses the JavaScript Web Speech API to turn your beautiful singing into text in real time. Once the text is determined, it is sent to the host to determine whether or not you sang the correct lyrics.

## Web App Development
The application programs reside on a remote server and that are delivered to players over the Internet. The client-side programming consists of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The client-side programming is powered through server-side programming, consisting of a custom inteface comprised of JSON, Javascript, and Python.
